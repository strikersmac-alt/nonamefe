## Troubleshooting

### "Please sign in to join the contest"

- Check that `authToken` cookie exists

### "Connection error"
- Ensure backend server is running on port 10000
- Check CORS settings in backend
- Verify Socket.IO is initialized correctly

### "Contest not found"
- Verify contest code is correct (6 characters)
- Check that contest exists in database
- Ensure contest hasn't already started

### Questions not loading
- Check backend API endpoint `/api/contest/:id/questions`
- Verify MongoDB connection
- Check browser console for errors

### Timer not working
- Ensure `startTime` is set when contest starts
- Check that duration is in minutes
- Verify browser time is synchronized

## API Endpoints Reference

GET  /api/contest/code/:code/questions
GET  /api/contest/:id/questions
POST /api/contest/:id/validate
```

## Known Issues & TODOs

### Minor TypeScript Warnings
- `setIsAdmin` in WaitingRoom - needs auth context integration
- `socket`, `setCurrentUserId` in Standings - can be removed if not needed
- These don't affect functionality

### Future Enhancements
1. Implement proper admin detection using auth context
2. Add user authentication context
3. Add loading skeletons for better UX
4. Add sound effects and animations
5. Add chat in waiting room
6. Add contest history page
7. Add leaderboard persistence
8. Add rematch functionality
